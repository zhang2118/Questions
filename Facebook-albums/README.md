This document aims to introduce the project stucture.


##app directory

1. All the business logics(controllers) and views are in this directory. I created 4 controllers who are in charge of 4 views respectively.However, there are only two html files in the views directory. One for the login action. The other is for the rest of views.

2. In the conf directory, there is a routes file, who is in charge of the mapping between the Restful APIs and controllers' methods. 

3. The public directory is where all the javascripts, css and image files are. 

4. The test files are in test directory.
