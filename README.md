Facebook Photo Albums

Facebook Photo Album is an assignment from Social Orra Inc. This is a part of job interview. They ask me to implement a web application by using mainly Angular.js, Facebook4j and Play framework on Java. In order to create a user-friendly interface, I used Bootstrap css. 

##Versions
Angular.js = 1.4.6
Facebook4j = 2.3.0
Play framework = 2.2.6
SBT = 0.3.0


##Installation
Make sure that you have play and SBT installed on your PC or Mac.
I installed Play framework from Home brew with the following command
`brew install play22`
For SBT use that following command.
`brew install sbt`


At first, I installed Play Framework 2.3.9, but I encountered some JDK issues when I started play. So I downgraded to 2.2.6.

##Start server
Go to the project directory. Tap `play` to launch play console. Then enter `run` or `run your_port`. The project will be running on the default port 9000 or the port you specified after `run` command.


##Application manual

There are 4 views in this application. Login view, Album list view, Album detail view and Photo view. <br />
