Facebook Photo Albums

Facebook Photo Album is an assignment from Social Orra Inc. This is a part of job interview. They ask me to implement a web application by using mainly Angular.js, Facebook4j and Play framework on Java. In order to create a user-friendly interface, I used Bootstrap css. 

##Versions
Angular.js => 1.4.6
Facebook4j => 2.3.0
Play framework => 2.2.6
SBT => 0.3.0


##Installation
Make sure that you have play and SBT installed on your PC or Mac.
I installed Play framework from Home brew with the following command
`brew install play22`
For SBT use that following command.
`brew install sbt`


At first, I installed Play Framework 2.3.9, but I encountered some JDK issues when I started play. So I downgraded to 2.2.6.
